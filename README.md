Stock market analysis using VBA

This VBA script quickly and efficiently analyzes large files of stock market data to provide the following metrics for each stock ticker:
  1. Yearly change in stock price from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    a. Conditionally formatted to show positive and negative changes.
  2. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  3. The total stock volume in that year.
Additionally, the code will also export the ticker with the greatest % increase in stock price, greatest % decrease in stock price and greatest total stock volume in a given worksheet. 
You only need to run this code once to retrive all of the above information for every worksheet within your excel file.

Enjoy!
